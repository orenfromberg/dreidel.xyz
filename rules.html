    <h1>Dreidel Game Rules</h1>
    <h4>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel">wikipedia</a>:</h4>
    <p>Each side of the dreidel bears a letter of the Hebrew alphabet: נ‎ (nun), ג‎ (gimel), ה‎ (hei), שׁ (shin).</p>
    <p>Each player begins with an equal number of game pieces (usually 10–15). The game pieces can be any object, such as chocolate gelt, pennies, raisins, etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To start the game, every participant puts one game piece into the center "pot". Every player also puts one piece into the pot when the pot is empty or there is only one game piece in the pot.</li>
        <li>
            Each player spins the dreidel once during their turn. Depending on which side is facing up when it stops spinning, the player whose turn it is gives or takes game pieces from the pot:
            <ul>
                <li>If נ‎ (nun) is facing up, the player does nothing.</li>
                <li>If ג‎ (gimel) is facing up, the player gets everything in the pot.</li>
                <li>If ה‎ (hei) is facing up, the player gets half of the pieces in the pot. If there are an odd number of pieces in the pot, the player takes half the pot rounded up to the nearest whole number.</li>
                <li>If שׁ (shin) is facing up, the player adds one of their game pieces to the pot.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the player is out of pieces, they are either "out" or may ask another player for a "loan".</li>
    </ul>
